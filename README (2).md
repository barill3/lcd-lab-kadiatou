Reaction time game with LCD

 this code execute a reaction time game; user has to press a button, waits for a random delay, displays 1234 and them measures the time it tkaes for the user to press the button again

   Arduino Uno, 16x2 LCD display, 10k resitor, wires, push button, breadboard

     Connections: 
Arduino Digital Pin 7 (RS) to LCD RS pin
Digital Pin 8  to LCD Enable (E) pin
